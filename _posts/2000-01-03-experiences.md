## **AWS-Crio Externship** *Mar 2021 - Apr 2021*

### An actual impactful externship 

This was the final stage of the multi-stage Crio Winter of Doing. The project was procured from AWS and mentored accordingly.

* Created an AWS Lambda Scheduler and Orchestrator Library from Scratch in a team of 2.
* I handled the effective working of the Library and the REST APIs it laid out while my partner designed the demo for it by using the Library in a Full Stack Web App.
* Used PostgreSQL for Database of the Scheduler and Orchestrator Events.
* Used these Events in an Event Driven Scheduler Script created using ShellScript and TypeScript.
* The APIs were vended as TypeScript methods within an instance of the Library Class.
* Orchestrator helped sequence out complicated schedules for AWS Lambda Triggering with multiple AWS Lambdas in place with their own meta if-else cases.
* Provided precision of less than a second in the from-scratch-scheduler.

## **Hack36 2020** *Feb 2020*

### We Won It. 

Organized by MNNIT Allahabad, this was a Major National College Hackathon, and we won it. 

The implemented and fully functioning code we created from scratch in 36 hours was an aid for ADHD diagnosis through visual cues served beside an Interactive Gaming Platform.

* I handled a major aspect of the app which was to poplulate a blinking-pattern graph for the end-user while serving an aesthetic Zen mode to cool down the supposed ADHD Patient. 
* This graph was processed in the background and immediately served up to be further accessible from the Public Cloud Service we used, while avoiding any PII of the patient.
* Thereby, I streamlined it into the major flow of deployment and put it up as a route while making sure that we got no CORS errors and it worked cross-platform.
